        E-commerce web architecture offers a wide range of advantages to both businesses and consumers. For businesses, e-commerce allows for a global reach and a 24/7 online presence, providing a level of convenience that traditional brick-and-mortar stores cannot match. E-commerce websites are also more cost-effective to set up and operate compared to physical stores, as they require less physical infrastructure and can be managed remotely. Additionally, e-commerce allows for more targeted marketing efforts through personalized recommendations and advertising, which can result in higher conversion rates and customer loyalty.
